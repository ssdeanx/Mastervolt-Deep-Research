# Summarization

Summarization shortens long conversations by inserting a system summary and keeping the last N non-system messages. It is configured per agent.

## Configuration​

```ts
import { Agent } from "@voltagent/core";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Assistant",
  instructions: "Answer questions clearly.",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  summarization: {
    enabled: true,
    triggerTokens: 120_000,
    keepMessages: 6,
    maxOutputTokens: 800,
    systemPrompt: "Summarize the conversation for the next step.",
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
  },
});
```

Options:

- `enabled`: Enable or disable summarization.
- `triggerTokens`: Token estimate threshold. The estimate uses a simple character-to-token heuristic.
- `keepMessages`: Number of most recent non-system messages kept after summarization.
- `maxOutputTokens`: Token budget for the summary generation call.
- `systemPrompt`: Prompt used for summary generation. If omitted, a default system prompt is used.
- `model`: Optional model for summarization; defaults to the agent model.

## How Summarization Runs​

On each request, VoltAgent:

- Removes any previous summary system message (identified by `<agent_summary>` markers).
- Calculates a token estimate for non-system messages.
- If `nonSystemMessages.length > keepMessages` and the token estimate meets `triggerTokens`, it generates a summary.
- Stores the summary state and injects a system message that contains the summary.
- Returns `[systemMessages, summaryMessage, tailMessages]` to the model.

If summary generation fails, the original sanitized messages are used.

The injected summary system message looks like:

```bash
<agent_summary>...summary text...</agent_summary>
```

## Storage Behavior​

Summary state is stored under the conversation metadata key `agent` when memory is enabled and `conversationId` is present. The state includes:

- `summary`
- `summaryMessageCount`
- `summaryUpdatedAt`

If memory is disabled or `conversationId` is missing, summary state is kept in process memory and resets on restart.

If you manage conversation metadata, reserve the `metadata.agent` key for VoltAgent summarization state.

## When To Use It​

Use summarization when conversation history grows past model limits or when token usage needs to be capped. Avoid it when you require full message fidelity for audits or deterministic replay.

## Notes for Framework Integrations​

- Pass `conversationId` consistently to keep summaries across requests.
- If you render messages in a UI, filter summary system messages by the `<agent_summary>` marker.
- If you hook into `onPrepareMessages`, that hook runs after summarization and receives the summary-injected message list.
