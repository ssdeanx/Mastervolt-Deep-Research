# Initial Concept

can you analyze current state of my project and help me create a modern landing page with animation/interactive ui/ux for public part of my project. you can check what i got in my packages but i want you make modular components for landing pages in ./app/_components/landing and check my global.css at ./app/global.css. Finally i want you to use gsap, gsap-react or whatever its called. i want you to also research latest gsap stylings. Also were using shadnui we have primitives in ./components/ui u can use those but pls no changing them they are critical for my ai chat. focus right now on making something that will surprise me.

# Product Guide: Mastervolt Public Landing Page

## 1. Overview
A high-performance, visually stunning landing page for the Mastervolt Deep Research system. The goal is to demonstrate the power of VoltAgent-based orchestration through a futuristic, high-tech interface that "surprises" users with immersive GSAP animations and interactive UI components. It serves as the gateway to the Mastervolt ecosystem, hinting at its expansion from deep research into trading tools and other agentic domains.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Enterprise AI Researchers & Developers:** Looking for scalable multi-agent frameworks.
- **Business Decision Makers:** Seeking automated research and data analysis solutions.
- **Open Source Enthusiasts:** Interested in cutting-edge agentic architectures.

## 3. Core Vision: "The Mission Control"
- **Visual Aesthetic:** Futuristic and high-tech. Dark mode base with neon "Volt Green" and electric blue accents. Terminal-style typography and GSAP-driven scroll-triggered animations.
- **Hero Experience:** An interactive "Agent Mission Control" dashboard. As users scroll, they "descend" through the system layers—from the high-level UI into the Director orchestrator and down into the semantic memory layer.
- **Interactivity:** A focus on "re-wireable" logic. Users should feel like they are interacting with a live system, not just a static site.

## 4. Key Features & Components
- **Mission Control Dashboard (GSAP):** Live-feeling data streams, heartbeats, and agent status indicators at the top of the page.
- **Multi-Domain Switcher:** An interactive node graph (using GSAP and xyflow patterns) showing the Director agent re-routing tasks between Research, Trading, and Data Analysis modules.
- **The "Surprise" Finale:** A functional, interactive Node Editor at the bottom of the page that allows users to "re-wire" the landing page's styling (colors, font weights) by connecting agent nodes.

## 5. Success Criteria
- **The "Wow" Factor:** Users are engaged by the fluid GSAP animations and high-end tech aesthetic.
- **Clarity of Purpose:** Despite the complex UI, users clearly understand that Mastervolt is a multi-agent orchestration engine.
- **Expansion Ready:** The UI modularly demonstrates how new domains (like trading) can be integrated into the existing architecture.
